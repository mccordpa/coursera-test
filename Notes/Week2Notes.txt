--Anatomy of CSS Rules--

-Example:

p {
   color: blue;
  }

In the above example, p (the HTML paragraph tag) is a Selector, inside the brackets is the CSS Declaration, 
which consists of the Property (ie, color) and the Value (ie, blue).
So all of the information in the CSS Declaration will be applied to all of the paragraphs in the HTML doc.

-The collection of all CSS rules is called a Style Sheet.


--Element, Class, and ID Selectors--

-Element selector:

p {
   color: blue;
  }
It is 'p' in the above. To call the Element selector in the HTML document, you just specify the element, 
like: <p>....</p>

-Class selector:

.blue {
	color: blue;
      }

In the above, .blue is the Class Name. To call the Class selector in the HTML document you have to do the
following: <p class="blue">....</p>

-ID selector:

#name {
	color: blue;
      }

To call the ID selector in the HTML document you have to do the following: <div id="name">....</div>
